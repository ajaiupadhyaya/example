## PROJECT CONCEPT

Build a **long-form scrollytelling data journalism piece** titled **"The Leveraged Machine"** — an interactive, deeply analytical web experience that dissects how private equity actually works: how firms acquire companies, load them with debt, extract fees, and exit — and what this means for workers, creditors, and the broader economy.

This is not a blog post with charts. It is a **narrative data experience** in the tradition of NYT's "The Upshot," Bloomberg's data journalism unit, and The Pudding — but pitched at the sophistication level of an institutional investor or financial economist. Every claim is backed by real data, every visualization is publication-quality, and the technical depth should be unmistakable.

**The piece should be genuinely revelatory** — showing things that are technically true but rarely visualized: the actual debt waterfall inside an LBO, the fee extraction mechanics, the divergence between PE-owned vs. public company outcomes for employees, the systemic risk embedded in leveraged loan markets.

## TECH STACK

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) — single deployable artifact
- **Scrollytelling:** `scrollama` library for scroll-triggered story steps
- **Animation:** `framer-motion` for transitions, `d3-transition` for chart animations
- **Charts/Viz:** D3.js (primary — full control), Recharts (supplementary), Plotly.js (3D/complex)
- **Maps:** D3-geo + TopoJSON for geographic flows
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS — editorial aesthetic (described below)
- **Data fetching:** Static JSON files generated by a Python data pipeline (no runtime API calls — all data pre-baked at build time for reliability)
- **Python pipeline:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `sec-edgar-downloader`, `fredapi`, `statsmodels`
- **Deployment:** Vercel (static export mode)
- **Typography:** Playfair Display (headlines) + IBM Plex Mono (data labels/numbers) + Source Serif Pro (body text)

**Aesthetic Direction:** Editorial dark — deep ink black (#0A0A0A) background, off-white (#F5F0E8) text, blood orange (#E84C1E) as primary accent, gold (#C9A84C) secondary. Feels like a premium financial magazine redesigned for the web. No gradients. No rounded corners on data elements. Sharp, authoritative, serious.

---

## NARRATIVE STRUCTURE (Scroll Sections)

The piece is divided into **8 Acts**. Each act has: a headline, a lede paragraph, one or more interactive visualizations, and annotation layers that appear on scroll. Build each act as a full-screen scroll section with the visualization on one side and narrative text stepping through on the other (classic Scrollama "side-by-side" pattern for desktop, stacked for mobile).

---

### ACT 1: "The Scale of the Shadow Economy"

**Thesis:** PE manages more capital than the GDP of every country except the US and China — and most people have no idea.

**Visualizations:**

1. **Animated bubble chart** — AUM of the 20 largest PE firms (Blackstone, Apollo, KKR, Carlyle, Ares, etc.) vs. GDP of nations. Bubbles scale by AUM. On scroll, bubbles rearrange to show: "Blackstone's AUM ($1T+) exceeds the GDP of Switzerland." Country bubbles fade in as comparators.

2. **Stacked area chart** — Global PE AUM growth 2000–2024. Layers: Buyout, Venture, Growth, Real Estate, Credit, Infrastructure, Secondary. Source: Preqin data (manually curated JSON). Annotate: 2008 crisis (barely a dip), 2021 peak, 2022-23 rate shock.

3. **Treemap** — PE-owned companies by sector (Healthcare, Retail, Media, Industrial, Tech, Financial Services). Size = estimated revenue of portfolio companies. Color intensity = leverage ratio estimate.

**Data Sources:**
- Firm AUM: manually curate from latest 10-K / investor relations pages of BX, APO, KKR, CG, ARES (SEC EDGAR)
- Historical AUM: Preqin Global Private Equity Report (public summary data)
- Portfolio company counts: PitchBook public data + manual research

---

### ACT 2: "Anatomy of a Buyout"

**Thesis:** An LBO is a machine for transferring risk onto the acquired company while concentrating returns at the top. Walk through the exact mechanics.

**Visualizations:**

1. **Animated LBO waterfall / Sankey diagram** — Show a $1B hypothetical acquisition:
   - Sources: 35% equity (PE fund), 65% debt (term loan B, senior secured notes, PIK toggle)
   - Uses: Purchase price, financing fees, transaction fees, management fees (paid to PE firm at close)
   - Animate each flow on scroll steps
   - Label: "The target company — not the PE firm — is responsible for this debt"

2. **Debt structure exploded view** — Visual decomposition of the capital stack:
   - Senior secured revolving credit facility (first lien)
   - Term Loan B (first lien, covenant-lite)
   - Second lien term loan
   - Senior unsecured notes
   - Subordinated / mezzanine
   - PIK (payment-in-kind) toggle notes
   - Preferred equity
   - Common equity (PE fund)
   - For each tranche: show typical rate (SOFR + spread), maturity, recovery rate in default, seniority icon
   - Use a vertical stack bar with color coding by risk level (green → red top to bottom)

3. **EBITDA bridge** — Show how PE firms "create value": revenue growth, margin expansion, multiple expansion, leverage paydown. Use a waterfall bar chart. Annotate: "In the 2010s, ~60% of PE returns came from multiple expansion — i.e., markets going up, not operational improvement." Cite academic source (Kaplan & Strömberg, Axelson et al.).

**Data Sources:**
- Real LBO structures: Parse SEC S-4 and 8-K filings for notable PE transactions (use `sec-edgar-downloader`)
- Pull actual debt terms from: Dell/EMC, Petco, Bausch Health, Envision Healthcare filings
- SOFR spreads: FRED series

---

### ACT 3: "The Fee Machine"

**Thesis:** PE firms collect fees at every stage — management fees, transaction fees, monitoring fees, exit fees — that are largely invisible to outside observers and represent a direct transfer from portfolio companies (and ultimately their workers and creditors) to the GP.

**Visualizations:**

1. **Fee flow diagram** — Animated Sankey showing all fee streams for a typical fund lifecycle:
   - LP capital committed → Management fee (2% annually on committed capital) → GP revenue
   - Portfolio company acquired → Transaction fee → GP revenue
   - Portfolio company owned → Monitoring fee (annual, paid by company) → GP revenue
   - Portfolio company sold → Exit/termination fee → GP revenue
   - Fund profits → Carried interest (20% of profits above hurdle) → GP revenue
   - Show: over a 10-year fund with 10 portfolio companies, total fees extracted

2. **Carried interest tax arbitrage visualization** — Show a $100M gain:
   - If taxed as ordinary income (fund manager salary): effective rate ~37%
   - If taxed as carried interest (capital gains): effective rate ~23.8%
   - The difference: $13.2M per $100M in carry
   - Aggregate across industry: estimate total annual tax subsidy to PE using IRS SOI data
   - Bar chart comparison, clearly labeled, annotated with legislative history (attempts to close loophole: 2008, 2017 partial reform, 2022 Inflation Reduction Act minor change)

3. **"2 and 20" erosion calculator** — Interactive slider: user sets fund size, return, holding period → see how much of gross return is consumed by fees. Show LP net return vs. gross return vs. what a passive index would have returned (S&P 500 equivalent). Use `recharts` for the interactive version.

**Data Sources:**
- Fee structures: SEC ADV Part 2 filings (publicly available) for Blackstone, KKR, Apollo, Carlyle — parse fee disclosure sections
- Carried interest tax data: Congressional Budget Office, Tax Policy Center public reports
- Fee erosion math: implement from first principles using standard PE math

---

### ACT 4: "The Debt Landscape"

**Thesis:** The leveraged loan and high-yield bond markets — the fuel for PE buyouts — have grown to systemic scale, with covenant protections stripped away, and are now concentrated in CLOs held by institutions with their own complex risk profiles.

**Visualizations:**

1. **Leveraged loan market growth** — Line chart, 2000–2024:
   - Total leveraged loan market outstanding (source: FRED LLOAN series + Fed Flow of Funds)
   - Covenant-lite share (% of new issuance) — annotate the rise from ~10% pre-2008 to 80%+ post-2015
   - High-yield bond market outstanding
   - Private credit (BDC + direct lending AUM) — the newest layer
   - Recession shading, Fed rate cycle overlay

2. **CLO anatomy diagram** — Exploded view of a Collateralized Loan Obligation:
   - Input: 200+ leveraged loans (show as small nodes flowing in)
   - Tranches output: AAA (60%), AA (9%), A (6%), BBB (5%), BB (4%), Equity (first-loss, 9%)
   - Show: who holds each tranche (insurance companies = AAA, hedge funds = equity, banks = various)
   - Animate default waterfall: when loans default, show losses hitting tranches from bottom up
   - Label: "The AAA tranche has never taken a loss in a CLO — but the equity tranche absorbs first losses and is held by... the CLO manager (another form of carry)"

3. **Spread compression chart** — BB-rated leveraged loan spread vs. risk-free rate over time. Annotate: "Investors are getting paid less to take the same credit risk than at any point pre-2008." Source: ICE BofA indices via FRED (BAMLH0A0HYM2).

4. **Maturity wall visualization** — Bar chart: leveraged loan and HY bond maturities by year (2024–2030). Show the "wall" of refinancing needs. Annotate with current rate environment. Source: use LCD/PitchBook public data or approximate from FRED.

**Data Sources:**
- FRED: LLCFNAI, BAMLH0A0HYM2, BAMLH0A1HYBB, corporate debt series
- Fed Flow of Funds: Z.1 release — financial accounts of the US
- CLO structure: replicate from industry standard (SIFMA, CFA Institute educational materials)

### ACT 5: "What Happens to the Companies"

**Thesis:** PE-owned companies have measurably different outcomes than their public or private non-PE peers — on employment, wages, bankruptcy rates, R&D spending, and long-term investment. The data tells a story the industry disputes but cannot refute.

**Visualizations:**

1. **Bankruptcy rate comparison** — Bar chart:
   - PE-backed companies: bankruptcy rate within 5 years of acquisition
   - Industry peers (public companies, same sector, same size cohort)
   - Source: Ayash & Rastad (2021) "Leveraged Buyouts and Financial Distress" — implement their methodology on public data
   - Notable PE bankruptcies: Toys R Us, Sears (ESL/Lampert), Revco, Envision Healthcare, Carestream — annotate on timeline

2. **Employment & wage outcomes** — Diverging bar chart:
   - PE-owned companies: avg employment change Y1–Y5 post-buyout
   - Comparable non-PE companies: same period
   - Source: Appelbaum & Batt research, Davis et al. (2014) NBER paper "Private Equity, Jobs, and Productivity"
   - Decompose: job creation at acquired firm vs. job destruction from divestitures — PE industry's preferred framing vs. net employment
   - Wage premium/discount for PE-owned vs. comparable sector

3. **R&D and Capex suppression** — Dual-axis line chart:
   - PE-owned company cohort: R&D spend as % of revenue pre- and post-buyout
   - Capex as % of revenue pre- and post-buyout
   - Public company comparables: same metrics
   - Source: Lerner, Sorensen & Strömberg (2011) on innovation; replicate on Compustat data

4. **Healthcare PE deep-dive** — Scatter plot: PE ownership intensity by healthcare subsector (physician practices, hospitals, hospice, behavioral health, dental) vs. cost increase and quality metric change. This is the most politically charged finding. Source: New England Journal of Medicine, Health Affairs public studies.

**Data Sources:**
- NBER working papers (Davis, Haltiwanger, Handley, Jarmin, Lerner, Miranda — "Private Equity, Jobs and Productivity")
- Compustat via WRDS (if accessible) or approximate from public company filings
- SEC EDGAR: bankruptcy filings for notable PE-owned companies
- CMS data: healthcare quality metrics (publicly available)

### ACT 6: "The Exit"

**Thesis:** PE firms exit investments in three ways — IPO, strategic sale, or secondary buyout (selling to another PE firm). Each exit mechanism has different implications for the company, its employees, and its future debt load. Secondary buyouts in particular represent a shell game that enriches GPs while loading companies with a second layer of leverage.

**Visualizations:**

1. **Exit route distribution** — Animated pie/donut chart evolving over time (2005→2024):
   - IPO exits, strategic sales, secondary buyouts, bankruptcy/write-off
   - Note: secondary buyouts have grown from ~15% to ~40%+ of exits
   - Source: Preqin public data, Bain Global PE Report public summaries

2. **Secondary buyout debt spiral** — Diagram following one company through 3 PE owners:
   - Company acquired: 5x leverage
   - Sold to PE firm #2: debt partially paid down to 3x, then re-levered to 6x for new deal
   - Sold to PE firm #3: re-levered again to 7x
   - Each time: new transaction fees, new monitoring fees, new management team churn
   - Show EBITDA growth required just to service each debt load
   - Animate the debt burden accumulating like a weight on the company

3. **IPO performance tracker** — Scatter plot: PE-backed IPOs (2010–2023) — 1-year post-IPO return vs. offering price. Compare to non-PE-backed IPOs same period. Source: Jay Ritter's IPO data (University of Florida, publicly available).

4. **Distribution waterfall** — For a sample fund, show how $1B in exit proceeds flows:
   - Return of capital to LPs
   - Preferred return (hurdle rate, typically 8%)
   - GP catch-up (100% to GP until GP has 20% of profits)
   - Carried interest split (80/20)
   - Visualize how LP gets $1B back but GP gets $200M+ in carry on a 2x fund
   - Interactive: slider to adjust MOIC → see carry change

---

### ACT 7: "The Systemic Picture"

**Thesis:** Private credit and leveraged lending have grown to a scale where distress in PE-owned companies could transmit to broader financial markets — through CLOs, BDCs, insurance company balance sheets, and pension fund LP commitments.

**Visualizations:**

1. **Contagion network graph** — D3 force-directed network:
   - Nodes: PE firms, Portfolio companies, CLO managers, Insurance companies, Pension funds, BDCs, Banks
   - Edges: capital flows, credit exposures
   - Size of node: AUM/exposure
   - Color: asset type
   - On scroll: highlight contagion pathways — "if leveraged loans default at 15%, trace losses through the network"
   - This is the signature visualization of the piece — make it stunning

2. **Private credit vs. bank lending displacement** — Area chart showing:
   - Traditional bank leveraged lending volume
   - Private credit (direct lending) volume
   - "The shift from regulated bank lending to unregulated private credit is the defining financial development of the 2020s"
   - Source: Fed Senior Loan Officer Survey (SLOOS), FRED bank credit data, BDC industry reports

3. **Interest coverage ratio deterioration** — Histogram: distribution of interest coverage ratios (EBITDA/Interest Expense) for leveraged loan borrowers:
   - 2019 (pre-COVID) distribution
   - 2023 (high rate environment) distribution
   - Overlay: share of borrowers below 1x coverage (technically insolvent on cash basis)
   - Source: LCD/Morningstar Leveraged Commentary — use public reported statistics

---

### ACT 8: "What Reform Would Look Like"

**Thesis:** Not a political screed — a data-driven examination of proposed policy interventions and their modeled effects. Show the math, not the ideology.

**Visualizations:**

1. **Carried interest reform scenario** — Bar chart: modeled revenue impact of taxing carry as ordinary income. Show range of estimates (CBO, Tax Policy Center, JCT). Annotate with industry lobbying spend against reform (OpenSecrets data).

2. **Leverage cap simulation** — Line chart: if LBOs were capped at 4x EBITDA (vs. current 6-8x average), how does it change:
   - Deal volume (estimated)
   - Average acquisition premium
   - Bankruptcy rate (modeled)
   - LP returns (modeled)
   - Show this as a scenario sensitivity, not a policy endorsement

3. **Transparency proposal scorecard** — Table/matrix: what PE firms currently disclose vs. what proposed SEC regulations (2023 Private Fund Adviser Rules — use actual rule text) would require. Color-coded compliance matrix.

**Data Sources:**
- OpenSecrets: PE/finance industry lobbying and campaign contribution data (API available)
- SEC: Proposed private fund rules (2023) — publicly available rulemaking documents
- CBO, JCT, Tax Policy Center: public carried interest reform estimates

---

## DATA PIPELINE (Python)

Build a `/data-pipeline` directory with Python scripts that generate static JSON files consumed by the frontend. Every dataset should be:
- Fetched from its source programmatically where possible
- Cleaned and normalized
- Saved as `/public/data/{dataset_name}.json`
- Documented with source, date retrieved, and any transformations

### Scripts to Build:

```
/data-pipeline
  fetch_fred_series.py        # Pull all FRED series (LLOAN, spreads, rates)
  fetch_sec_filings.py        # Parse PE firm 10-K/ADV filings for fee data
  build_lbo_model.py          # Generate LBO waterfall data for Act 2
  build_clo_anatomy.py        # CLO tranche structure data for Act 4
  build_exit_scenarios.py     # Distribution waterfall math for Act 6
  build_contagion_network.py  # Network graph node/edge data for Act 7
  curate_pe_aum.py            # Manual + scraped AUM data for Act 1
  curate_bankruptcy_data.py   # PE bankruptcy cases with dates/debt loads
  build_scenario_models.py    # Reform scenario math for Act 8
  validate_all.py             # Check all JSON files for schema conformance
```

Each script must: log its data sources, print a summary of records fetched, and write a `_metadata.json` alongside each dataset.

---

## SCROLLYTELLING IMPLEMENTATION

Use `scrollama` with the following pattern for each act:

```javascript
// Each act: full-screen section
// Left 60%: sticky visualization container
// Right 40%: scrolling narrative steps

const actConfig = {
  offset: 0.5,           // trigger at 50% viewport
  debug: false,
  progress: true,        // for smooth animation triggers
}

// Each step triggers:
// 1. Chart state transition (animate to new state)
// 2. Annotation layer update (highlight specific elements)
// 3. Narrative text fade in
```

**Transition requirements:**
- Every chart state change must animate smoothly (300-600ms, ease-in-out)
- No jarring cuts between scroll steps
- On mobile: stack layout, swipe-triggered (use intersection observer fallback)
- Progress indicator: subtle dot nav on right side showing current act

---

## VISUALIZATION QUALITY STANDARDS

Every single chart must meet these standards — no exceptions:

- **Source citation** — every chart has a visible, clickable source line
- **Methodology note** — hover or expandable note explaining how the data was computed
- **Uncertainty display** — where data is estimated, show confidence range or "estimated" label
- **Axis labels** — always labeled with units, never assume the reader knows
- **Color accessibility** — pass WCAG AA contrast. Never use red/green as the only distinguishing factor
- **Responsive** — every chart redraws correctly at 320px, 768px, 1280px, 1920px
- **Export** — every chart has a download button (PNG + underlying CSV)
- **No chartjunk** — no 3D bar charts, no pie charts with more than 5 slices, no dual-axis charts without explicit justification

**Signature visual treatments (implement these):**
- **Annotation arrows** — D3-drawn curved arrows pointing to specific data points with labels, appear on scroll
- **"Redline" highlights** — when a metric crosses a threshold (e.g., coverage ratio < 1x), the line turns blood orange
- **Ghost lines** — historical average shown as a faint dotted line behind current data
- **Step-in reveals** — chart elements animate in sequentially, not all at once
- **Datum callouts** — on key data points, a pill-shaped callout appears with exact value + context

---

## PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

- Lighthouse score: 90+ on all metrics
- All data pre-loaded at build time (no runtime API calls = no loading spinners)
- D3 charts use `canvas` rendering (not SVG) for datasets > 1,000 points
- Images: WebP format, lazy loaded
- Fonts: self-hosted, preloaded
- First contentful paint: < 1.5s
- Total page weight: < 3MB (excluding fonts)

---

## EDITORIAL COPY REQUIREMENTS

Write actual, publication-quality prose for each act — not placeholder text. The copy should:
- Open each act with a concrete, specific example (a real company, a real deal, a real number)
- Use the "specific → systemic" structure: start with one company's story, zoom out to the industry
- Never editorialize beyond what the data shows — but let the data speak loudly
- Match the tone of: NYT DealBook, FT Alphaville, Bloomberg Businessweek long-form

Example lede for Act 2:
> "When KKR acquired Petco in 2006 for $1.68 billion, the pet retailer took on $1.3 billion in debt it did not choose, to fund a transaction it did not initiate. The company's new owners put in $380 million of equity. The dog food chain put in the rest."

Write equivalent quality ledes for all 8 acts. These should be in the codebase as constants, not CMS-managed.

---
